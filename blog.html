      The plan is to commit suicide on the 30th, one week from now. Angel says he'll let me use his gun, as long as he can video record my death and post it online. I don't feel comfortable
 with that, but I'm so desperate and this is my only chance to actually die, so i'm taking it. I won't have the capacity to care about tjat video if i am dead. I just need him to keep his word.
      <br>I'm sad it's come to this. There used to be some things i used to enjoy, like drawing and coding, that kept me around for so long. I don't think I'll leave a note. It's too hard to think. I haven't slept or eaten much over the past few weeks. Angel has been making me eat
       only DOG FOOD because he thinks i am fat. I AM 90 POUNDS. i am living in hell. There is no  hope left and i wish i could get things over with sooner. I won't be able to say bye to my cats but 
      they have my family to take care of them wstill. i'm happy with this. I really am happy with it.

    Today I mostly cleaned up around the apartment and drew in my sketchbook.
     I was sitting on the floor watching him play Valorant when he got a call from his girlfriend. He handed me his controller and told me to make sure he didn't die. 
    I suck at shooter games so i died pretty quickly. 
    He was pissed when he got off the phone and he squeezed my neck really hard. i don't remember passing out but i woke up and my whole body was spasming.
    He said I always ruin everything.

I apologize if this is entry worded and structured weirdly, as right now, I am hungover and completely disoriented. I haven't updated this site in almost exactly a month. To be honest, I just feel like dying most days.
<br>
I took a recreational dose of benadryl last night, and I feel so disoriented and unreal today. I slept for at least 14-15 hours, but I still feel tired. My vision has been shaking all day, like jittering.
<br>
My birthday was last month. it was okay. I didn't do much, but my friend walked over to my house and gave me a card and some ponies. I also got a speaker from my parents, which made me happy. I feel even worse about myself as i get older, I'm 17 now. I feel like such a failure. I'm usually alone, so I just sit in the dark of my room and listen to music most of the time. My favorite albums to put on and code to right now are The Origin of My Depression by Uboa and Panchiko's D>E>A>T>H>M>E>T>A>L.
<br>
I have less than a month to do 20 hours of drivers ed, too. I just feel like I'm falling apart, everytime I think I've reached the lowest possible point in my life, I just keep getting lower. Sometimes the emotional pain manifests as aches all over my body. I'm just in this weird rut of existential dread as I get older. I used to have a promising future, but I feel like it's hopeless now. I threw it away and it's too late to redeem myself. </p>

    It's been awhile since i updated my blog. I had physical therapy today. It's not really helping because my hip joints are still subluxing every day. I already have 
    arthritis and my doctor said i'll need to replace them eventually because of the damage. I'm trying to prevent it from worsening with physical therapy because there's no way
     I could afford such a surgery.<br>I went to a Halloween concert for my birthday. I only really went to see Bejalvin's 100 gecs cover set, the other cover sets were for numetal bands like Limp Bizkit and Korn, which I don't really listen to. Costumes were mandatory, so I went as Fluttershy, and a few people recognized my costume there, which was really exciting! I made the skirt and wings by myself.
   I went trick or treating  with my friends this year. I might be getting too old now, but i had fun.<br>I am feeling excited to continue writing here again<br><iframe width="280" height="162" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8AW1V8LOAw8?si=uYNX_WByHFx4vf-p" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<div id="entry5"><div style="border-bottom: .2em dashed blue; text-align:right;">01/01/2025</div><p>Happy New Year! I can't believe it's 2025 already, the past few years have gone by so quickly!! It'll be a big year for me because I'll be graduating high school. I'm really nervous about graduating, despite being homeschooled for the most part. I don't feel ready to be an adult still.

A week before Christmas, I learned that one of my only friends was killed in a horrific car accident. She was in her grandma's car when it was hit by an airborne truck. Her grandma and father died immediately, and she died a few days later in the hospital. She would've just turned 17 this month I'd do anything to talk with her again, it hurts so much and the guilt has been eating away at me.<br>
My Christmas was okay otherwise. My parents got me a Raspberry Pi. I don't know what I'll do with it yet.<br><img src="https://files.catbox.moe/szhmc7.png"></p>
