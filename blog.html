       Every morning My adrenaline shakes me awake like a LOUD blaring alarm clock. there's a deep chill in my bones and nausea creeping up my throat. 
    Some days, I can wait out the worst of it, but on others, I'm dry heaving into the afternoon.Even Angel has been encouraging me to gain weight but It wasnt validating just apathetic. The only thing that inspired me to get out of bed was stepping on the scale every morning and seeing the number plummet.
    I'm worried my parents will want to admit me when they see me again. There's nothing gained from forcibly tubefeeding me, it's almost traumatic, all of the painstaking 
    progress i've made ripped away, yet no treatment for my actual eating disorder, so the cycle repeats when i get home. if anything, i just want to lose it even faster!!<br><br>
     I wish i didn't leave the shelter so badly, I really feel like it was my only hope at survival, i think i'll die here, but I feel so terrible for wasting 
    their resources, resources that are already running low as it is. He told me to write an apology letter to the shelter but I'm not going to. I didn't lie about anything and i 
    feel too humiliated.<br><br>
    My birthday would be next month, but I just can't let myself live to 19,i'm not contributing anything to the world. i just feel So 
    guilty for being here for so long.
     im lonely. I miss CJ and i miss my mom and my cats but i only make thigns worse for everypony. 
     Angel hasnt said a word to me all night. I think he was the last person who even bothered with me. 
<br><br>
I cut him in rhe face with scissors and he was bkeeding all over me. i didnt want to hurt him was just trying to get away. But i feel so guily i only make everyone  miserable. He ripped apart my stuffed bear. it's Rly dumb but that stupid bear helped me To sleep at night.
    Eveb when i wake up in pain, i would just squeeze him really tight until it was over. 
     He says i need to stop relying on childish stuff and i;ll be grateful for this one day. I tried to save the pieces but he is really mangled & i don't have a needle nor thread right now to try to fix it.<br><br> 
    This time I'm walking to the bridge alone and jumping myself. I can't swim so if the fall doesn't kill me (which it likely won't, it's not a very high fall) I'm sure to drown? i've tried this before and my surviavl instinct was too strong but i have ativan and xanax this time.
     I can't just keep leeching off of other people because I'm helpless by myself. I'm a net negative.

    <p>Yesterday, he said if i wasn't dead by the time he was home, he would kill me. But i didn't want to 
    die last night because i was  really scared, i coulnd't bring myself to do it. When he got home he was really gentle and kind to me. He 
    said it wasn't too late, he helped me retie the rope to the door and i hung myself. I didnt rven go unconscious He just grabbed me and apologized over nad over. He was crying 
     and begging me not to die. I felt confused but kind of relieved but super duper confused

    <p>My plans were obviously postponed! I don't want to write about that right now. Instead, I dedicate this entry to my dearest late 
    friend CJ.<br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/UUNRQwS.jpeg" width=33%><br><br>CJ was my best (and only) friend. We met online when I was 14. I was feeling completely alone and out of sheer 
      desperation, i created a discord server (lol) with just myself, and posted it on disboard. CJ was my first member. 
    We hit it off instantly because we were super similar and only a year apart, her being 13 at the time. I got her into drain gang and music became our favorite thing to talk about. 
      Both of us felt rather aimless, we both had primarily creative interests and a fear of growing up. CJ and I both struggled with anorexia and we bonded really strongly over that. i think a lot of anorexics
       are scared to become adults and try to cling onto childhood. I'm sure it has to do with the lack of control, but it was 
      hard to find other people who understood. We were so locked in, we were oomfs on edtwt.
<br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/Q7nOnGS.jpeg" width=40%><br>she was so based!<br><br>
    i was isolating a lot last summer so i didn't think much of it when 
    she stopped replying for a month or two. I noticed the absence of her usual instagram stories but just assumeed she was having fun with her new school friends, she was finally 
      recovering from her eating disorder and seemed so much happier. 
      i was radnomly checking her profile for any updates when i saw a couple "rip" comments on her last post. My heart dropped but i didn't believe she died, i thought it was some ssort of joke. 
    i searched her name and state, an obituary was the first result. i was crying for several hours before i could even feel sad, it was unreal. For weeks, I was sobbing hard nonstop, only interspersed with numbness from 
      exhaustion.<br><br>CJ was on a road trip with her family. 
     Her grandma was driving with her dad in the passenger seat, and CJ and her older sister in the back. They had just gotten lunch and they were on their way to a concert. 
    They were stopped at an intersection when an airborne truck crashed into them from an opposing street, hitting the car from CJ's side. CJ's grandma and father
     were pronounced dead on the scene. CJ and her sister were airlifted to hospital but only her sister survived and CJ was pronounced 
    braindead a few days later. it's too tragic, she was soooooo young. She loved baking, drawing, ballet. she was sooo kindhearted and frequently volunteered at shelters. she was just infectiously positive, even
       when she wasn't so happy hereslf, she was just So good :(
   </p><P>i would give anything 
    to be able to talk to her, i just want some sort of closure, it;s unnerving shes not even Here anymore she doesnt even exist my lovely friend???. WTF :( 
      I never asked her what she thought about Cold Visions, but she added every single song to her playlist. We had our own spotify playlist too, she added so many more songs than me. 
      I think she always put more effort than me and i'll always feel guilty. I loved her so much but i just isolate myself. I took her for granted and
       assumed we had unlimited time together, that there was always tomorrow. I'm crushed.</P><img src="https://files.catbox.moe/t4mdk0.png" height=10%><img src="https://i.imgur.com/eAvdeFi.jpeg" height=10%></div>

 Angel says he'll let me use his gun but he wants to record it and post it online. I feel terrible about it but  so desperate too. I guess i wouldnt have the capacity to care about tjat video if i were dead.
      <br><br>I don't think I'll leave a note behind, it's too hard to think anymore. i havnet been sleeping well.. made made me eat
        DOG FOOD because he thinks i am fat. I AM 90 POUNDS<br><br>

  <div id="entry2"><div style="border-bottom: .2em dashed blue; text-align:right;">7/15/2025</div><P>
    Today I mostly cleaned up around the apartment and drew in my sketchbook. i'm staying at my friend's house until i have another place to stay. 
    He has always been sort of an erratic guy.. while babysitting me as a kid he would always show me gore videos and even 
     Yesterday I was sitting on the floor watching him play Valorant when he got a call from his girlfriend. He handed me his controller and told me to ensure he didn't lose. 
    i was so caught off guard, i died pretty quickly!! i suck at shooter games and ive never even used an xbox controller.
    He was so pissed when he got off the phone and  squeezed my neck really hard. He kept asking why i  ruin everything. when i woke up my body was convulsing. it took me a little while to remember what happened.
    </p><p>I'm yearning BAD... I just daydream all day about people who were nice to me in brief interactions. But im not good at talking to people so i never get to know anyone. Maybe it's for the best, i usually disappoint in the end.</p>
  </P></div>
  <div id="entry6"><div style="border-bottom: .2em dashed blue; text-align:right;">3/23/2025</div><p>I'm always in my head but i rarely vocalize any of my thoughts, usually just scribble them down for no one else to ever see. it feels like i've lost the ability to talk to others entirely, my social anxiety has gotten so bad. Everything about me is humiliating and it's not worth ruminating about Every little thing i said for days. just thinking about how others percieve me makes me feel nauseous but i cant stop obsessing over it. I cant reply to any of my friends because i cannot conjure a perfect message to my own skewed standards, especially through layers of brain fog.. Everypony else has a job now so i can't see them so much anymore. I am the most incapable person in the world truly!!<br><br>I get sweaty and i stutter talking to people and i can tell everyone thinks i'm a freak. When i go to parties, it's hard for me to match others' energy. I'm kind but everything i say feels pathetic and awkward. When people talk to me, i feel like it's really out of pity or some alterior motive. My friend texted me the other day that all of his friends love me
     and i was even invited to a birthday party coming up, so i know my perception of myself must be somewhat distorted, or maybe they don't mind that i'm so pathetic.<br><br>
     I would call myself a femcel but smoehow attract men despite my social ineptitude. i dont know why me, maybe i just seem vulnerable. i wish i made friends so easily instead. I've never willingly slept with someone. I only really associate sex with violence, it's hard for me to wrap my head around the idea that someone could be attracted to me without wanting to hurt me. Is this special kind of gentleness reserved to only those who deserve it?</p></div>

I haven't updated this in almost 2 months. TBH i just feel like dying most days and i cant bring myself to do anything producitve. last year i told my paremts i would blow my brains out 
    if i had to stay in public school, i'm just 
    taking a few electives inperson while i do the rest online. there's a lunch period between those classes. i used to wait it out in the library and draw because it's so peaceful in there, 
    but there's this evil boy named qwinton...he follows me eberwhere i go... :( i will tell the story of qwinton but its really sad...<br><br>He was in my science class last year and just latched onto me i think. 
    he  would say such intense things like "my life changed when i met u" amd make disturbing jokes like calling me flat chesetd or a loli during class. i would just ignore it because i didnt know how to react...
    <br><br> he was really insistant so i let him walk me home one day after school. i REALLY shouldnt have, he started showing up all the time and  he would tell my mom how much he liked me, he even opened up about his coke habit & blackout rages. 
    i really should've set firm boundaries sooner, im such a pushover :P<br><br>
    Things were spiraling fast and i started dreading school, one day i skipped class and classmates told me that he cried at his desk until he was sent to the office...he started getting angry when i spoke to male peers...
    I remember one time, his backpack was confiscated by a resource officer, he never told me what was inside...
    eventually i toold him i was uncomfortable and he got really defensive and never spoke with me again (which i was ok with LOL.)<br><br>This year, he got a GF and the following began... I always 
    try to find somewhere quiet to sit during lunch so i can draw, but they ALWAYS sit right across from me and MAKE OUT.
    i dont know if he's trying to make me feel jealous or soemthing but i just find it gross and annoying, him and his friends are so loud i just want to be alone. my eternal tormentors...i dont even know why brooo i was alwys nice T__T
<br><br>
I took so much benadryl last night, feeling disoriented and unreal today. I slept for like 14 hours  but im exhausted. My vision has been kinda jittering all day. NEVER AGAIN..
<br><br>
My birthday was last month. it was okay. I didn't do much, but my friend walked over to my house and gave me a card and some ponies. I also got a speaker from my parents, which made me happy. I feel even worse about myself as i get older, I'm 17 now and I'm still going nowhere. I feel like such a failure. I'm usually alone, so I just sit in the dark of my room and listen to music most of the time. Sometimes i draw. I love listening to bladee adn cocteau twins.

    It's been awhile since i updated my blog. I had physical therapy today, she gave me some new exercises to strengthen my chest area because my rib keep shifting over my 
    sternum and i have to pop it back in. All i can do is try to strengthen the muscles a bit where my joints are unstable. I learned recently that hEDS is usually more severe in women 
    because they hve lower muscle mass, less support keeping their joints in place.<br><br>I went to a Halloween concert for my birthday. I only really went to see Bejalvin's 100 gecs cover set, the others were for numetal bands like Limp Bizkit and Korn, which I don't Rly listen to. It was so much fun it was really worth it..... I went as Fluttershy. a few people recognized my costume there!! I made the skirt and wings myself.
   I went trick or treating  with my friends this year. I feel like we're getting a little old for it now, but they always insist, and i had fun.<br><iframe width="280" height="162" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8AW1V8LOAw8?si=uYNX_WByHFx4vf-p" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<div id="entry5"><div style="border-bottom: .2em dashed blue; text-align:right;">01/01/2025</div><p>i can't believe it's 2025 already.. the past few years have gone by so quickly. It'll be a big year for me because I'll be studying abroad in Japan for a month and graduating high school too.. I'm really nervous about graduating, despite being homeschooled for the most part. I don't rly feel ready to be an adult still.<br><br>

Last month i found out that my dear friend was killed in a horrific car accident. She was in her grandma's car when it was hit by an airborne truck. Her grandma and father died immediately, and she passed a few days later in the hospital. She would've just turned 17 and She wanted to work at a bakery next summer. She was so so kind and funny and she loved drain gang so we always talked about it together.. I'll really miss enjoying new music with her. Her kindness & positivity were so infectious, i could only strive to be half as generous as her. i miss her so bad. I haven't been able to stop crying every day. I'd do anything to talk with her just once more, it hurts so much and the guilt has been eating away at me. why do people like her 
  die so tragically and suddenly? she had so much more potential, i wish it was me so badly :(<br>
My Christmas was okay otherwise. My parents got me a Raspberry Pi. I don't know what I'll do with it yet.<br><img src="https://files.catbox.moe/szhmc7.png"></p>

  </div><p>My grandma died last month. Her body, which had been partially eaten by her cats, wasn't found for an entire week. She mustve been lonely because she wrote my dad as her sole emergency contact, despite not having contact with him for years.
     I first met her at 5 years old when we were visiting family in Arizona, after my dad lost his job to the great recession.<br><br> 
    We iniially stayed with my uncle for a few weeks. He's a weird guy, would always get angry and punish me for silly reasons, like 
    not speaking to him (i was mute at the time, my parents always tried explaining that to him.)<br><br>
    My grandma ended up giving us her two-story house for free, so we didn't stay with my ucnle for long. I remember being scared of my grandma, she would get upset for such little reasons too. the house had roaches but i had my own bedroom, i can't remember what it looked like anymore.
    <br><br>One night, my dad got a call from my grandma. she said if we weren't entirely moved out in an hour, she'd call the police.
   My parents sent me on a walk with my uncle while they rushed to pack the hosue. I was skipping and running to try
   to distract myself from the anxiety, but my uncle told me to stop. I was holding back tears because i thought my parents would go to jail. 
    The cops were sent, but my parents explained the situation adn they were understanding, we left Arizona after that.<br></Br>I did lose 
  my cat Sadie because my parents couldn't grab her in time, she was hiding from all the chaos and my grandma aws threatening my dad with a knife. i missed Sadie a lot But im over it now.</p></div></div></div><div class="box2" id="shortnav" style="width:20.5%; border:.1em black solid; position:relative;"><center>
