       Every morning My adrenaline shakes me awake like a LOUD blaring alarm clock. there's a deep chill in my bones and nausea creeping up my throat. 
    Some days, I can wait out the worst of it, but on others, I'm dry heaving into the afternoon.Even Angel has been encouraging me to gain weight but It wasnt validating just apathetic. The only thing that inspired me to get out of bed was stepping on the scale every morning and seeing the number plummet.
    I'm worried my parents will want to admit me when they see me again. There's nothing gained from forcibly tubefeeding me, it's almost traumatic, all of the painstaking 
    progress i've made ripped away, yet no treatment for my actual eating disorder, so the cycle repeats when i get home. if anything, i just want to lose it even faster!!<br><br>
     I wish i didn't leave the shelter so badly, I really feel like it was my only hope at survival, i think i'll die here, but I feel so terrible for wasting 
    their resources, resources that are already running low as it is. He told me to write an apology letter to the shelter but I'm not going to. I didn't lie about anything and i 
    feel too humiliated.<br><br>
    My birthday would be next month, but I just can't let myself live to 19,i'm not contributing anything to the world. i just feel So 
    guilty for being here for so long.
     im lonely. I miss CJ and i miss my mom and my cats but i only make thigns worse for everypony. 
     Angel hasnt said a word to me all night. I think he was the last person who even bothered with me. 
<br><br>
I cut him in rhe face with scissors and he was bkeeding all over me. i didnt want to hurt him was just trying to get away. But i feel so guily i only make everyone  miserable. He ripped apart my stuffed bear. it's Rly dumb but that stupid bear helped me To sleep at night.
    Eveb when i wake up in pain, i would just squeeze him really tight until it was over. 
     He says i need to stop relying on childish stuff and i;ll be grateful for this one day. I tried to save the pieces but he is really mangled & i don't have a needle nor thread right now to try to fix it.<br><br> 
    This time I'm walking to the bridge alone and jumping myself. I can't swim so if the fall doesn't kill me (which it likely won't, it's not a very high fall) I'm sure to drown? i've tried this before and my surviavl instinct was too strong but i have ativan and xanax this time.
     I can't just keep leeching off of other people because I'm helpless by myself. I'm a net negative.

    <p>Yesterday, he said if i wasn't dead by the time he was home, he would kill me. But i didn't want to 
    die last night because i was  really scared, i coulnd't bring myself to do it. When he got home he was really gentle and kind to me. He 
    said it wasn't too late, he helped me retie the rope to the door and i hung myself. I didnt rven go unconscious He just grabbed me and apologized over nad over. He was crying 
     and begging me not to die. I felt confused but kind of relieved but super duper confused

    <p>My plans were obviously postponed! I don't want to write about that right now. Instead, I dedicate this entry to my dearest late 
    friend CJ.<br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/UUNRQwS.jpeg" width=33%><br><br>CJ was my best (and only) friend. We met online when I was 14. I was feeling completely alone and out of sheer 
      desperation, i created a discord server (lol) with just myself, and posted it on disboard. CJ was my first member. 
    We hit it off instantly because we were super similar and only a year apart, her being 13 at the time. I got her into drain gang and music became our favorite thing to talk about. 
      Both of us felt rather aimless, we both had primarily creative interests and a fear of growing up. CJ and I both struggled with anorexia and we bonded really strongly over that. i think a lot of anorexics
       are scared to become adults and try to cling onto childhood. I'm sure it has to do with the lack of control, but it was 
      hard to find other people who understood. We even followed each other on edtwt, we were so locked in.
<br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/Q7nOnGS.jpeg" width=40%><br>she was so based!<br><br>
    It really felt like we were surviving through something together. We were friends for a few years and we planned to meet up this year because she was
     going to be in my state. She was often busy when school first started up and i was super depressed so i didn't think much of it when 
    she stopped replying to my texts for a month or two. I remember just assuming she was having fun with her new friends from school, since she was finally 
      recovering from her eating disorder and seemed so much happier. 
     i checked her instagram profile one day, and i saw a couple "rip" comments on her latest post. My heart dropped but i thought it mustve been some sort of joke, i was struggling to process it. 
    I immediately searched her full name and state online just to make sure there was nothing there, but i ended up finding an obituary. I was devastated. I was sobbing so hard from the moment i woke up until i cried myself to sleep, only interspersed with brief periods of numbness from 
      sheer exhaustion.<br><br>After a few weeks, i began researching somewhat obsessively. 
      I wanted to know everything i could about her final moments, i was searching for any semblance of closure 
      that i'm still yet to find. I wish i could know what she what she was thinking before it happened, 
      if it was painful or if she fell unconscious fast. Did she know she was going to die? Her last post on her 
      private instagram was about how she wanted to die all day. That makes me real sad. 
      I found a few articles that went into detail about the crash and i could roughly piece together what happened. 
      <br><br>CJ was on a road trip with her family. 
     Her grandma was driving with her dad in the passenger seat, and CJ and her older sister in the back. They had just gotten lunch and they were on their way to a concert. 
    They were stopped at an intersection when an airborne truck crashed into them from an opposing street, hitting the car from CJ's side. CJ's grandma and father
     were pronounced dead on the scene. CJ and her sister were airlifted to hospital but only her sister survived and CJ was pronounced 
    braindead a few days later. I haven't been the same since i found out. Even a year later, i still think about it every day, and 
    i just wish so badly that it was me instead. She had so much going for her and i knew she was going to do something great. She loved baking and planned to apply for a job at the bakery that year. She was 
    a ballet dancer, she loved helping and frequently volunteered at humane societies and homeless shelters. She was the kindest person i've met 
    and so uplifting. I stgill can't process it. it's too painful and i've been completely alone ever since.</p><P>i would give anything 
    to be able to talk to her one last time. If there were a definitive afterlife, i would kill myself right now just to talk to her and feel her warmth one last time, just to get the closure im desperate for. 
      I never asked her what she thought about Cold Visions, but i saw she added every song to her playlist. We had our own shared playlist too, and she added so many more songs than me, so i feel guilty about that as well. 
      I think she always put more effort than me. I loved her but i was so depressed and sometimes i isolated myself. I took her for granted and
       assumed we just had infinite time together, that there was always tomorrow. I'm crushed.</P><img src="https://i.imgur.com/eAvdeFi.jpeg" width=40%></div>

 Angel says he'll let me use his gun but he wants to record it and post it online. I feel terrible about it but  so desperate too. I guess i wouldnt have the capacity to care about tjat video if i were dead.
      <br><br>I don't think I'll leave a note behind, it's too hard to think anymore. i havnet been sleeping well.. made made me eat
        DOG FOOD because he thinks i am fat. I AM 90 POUNDS<br><br>

    Today I mostly cleaned up around the apartment and drew in my sketchbook. i'm staying at my friend's house until i have another place to stay. 
    He has always been sort of an erratic guy.. while babysitting me as a kid he would always show me gore videos and even 
     Yesterday I was sitting on the floor watching him play Valorant when he got a call from his girlfriend. He handed me his controller and told me to ensure he didn't lose. 
    i was so caught off guard, i died pretty quickly!! i suck at shooter games and ive never even used an xbox controller.
    He was so pissed when he got off the phone and  squeezed my neck really hard. He kept asking why i  ruin everything. when i woke up my body was convulsing. it took me a little while to remember what happened.
    </p><p>I'm yearning BAD... I just daydream all day about people who were nice to me in brief interactions. But im not good at talking to people so i never get to know anyone. Maybe it's for the best, i usually disappoint in the end.</p>
  </P></div>
  <div id="entry6"><div style="border-bottom: .2em dashed blue; text-align:right;">3/23/2025</div><p>I'm always in my head but i rarely vocalize any of my thoughts, usually just scribble them down for no one else to ever see. it feels like i've lost the ability to talk to others entirely, my social anxiety has gotten so bad. Everything about me is humiliating and it's not worth ruminating about Every little thing i said for days. just thinking about how others percieve me makes me feel nauseous but i cant stop obsessing over it. I cant reply to any of my friends because i cannot conjure a perfect message to my own skewed standards, especially through layers of brain fog.. Everypony else has a job now so i can't see them so much anymore. I am the most incapable person in the world truly!!<br><br>I get sweaty and i stutter talking to people and i can tell everyone thinks i'm a freak. When i go to parties, it's hard for me to match others' energy. I'm kind but everything i say feels pathetic and awkward. When people talk to me, i feel like it's really out of pity or some alterior motive. My friend texted me the other day that all of his friends love me
     and i was even invited to a birthday party coming up, so i know my perception of myself must be somewhat distorted, or maybe they don't mind that i'm so pathetic.<br><br>
     I would call myself a femcel but smoehow attract men despite my social ineptitude. i dont know why me, maybe i just seem vulnerable. i wish i made friends so easily instead. I've never willingly slept with someone. I only really associate sex with violence, it's hard for me to wrap my head around the idea that someone could be attracted to me without wanting to hurt me. Is this special kind of gentleness reserved to only those who deserve it?</p></div>

I haven't updated this in almost a month. To be honest, I just feel like dying most days. I can't bring myself to do anything.
<br><br>
I took a high dose of benadryl last night, and I feel so disoriented and unreal today. I slept for at least 14-15 hours, but I still feel tired. My vision has been shaking all day, like jittering.
<br><br>
My birthday was last month. it was okay. I didn't do much, but my friend walked over to my house and gave me a card and some ponies. I also got a speaker from my parents, which made me happy. I feel even worse about myself as i get older, I'm 17 now and I'm still going nowhere. I feel like such a failure. I'm usually alone, so I just sit in the dark of my room and listen to music most of the time. Sometimes i draw. I love listening to bladee adn cocteau twins.</p>

    It's been awhile since i updated my blog. I had physical therapy today. It's not really helping because my hip joints are still subluxing every day. I already have 
    arthritis and my doctor said i'll need to replace them eventually because of the damage. I'm trying to prevent it from worsening with physical therapy because there's no way
     I could afford such a surgery. But i'm demotivated.<br><br>I went to a Halloween concert for my birthday. I only really went to see Bejalvin's 100 gecs cover set, the others were for numetal bands like Limp Bizkit and Korn, which I don't Rly listen to. Costumes were mandatory, so I went as Fluttershy, and a few people recognized my costume there!! I made the skirt and wings by myself..
   I went trick or treating  with my friends this year. I might be getting too old now, but i had fun. Im excited to continue updating here again..<br><iframe width="280" height="162" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8AW1V8LOAw8?si=uYNX_WByHFx4vf-p" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<div id="entry5"><div style="border-bottom: .2em dashed blue; text-align:right;">01/01/2025</div><p>i can't believe it's 2025 already.. the past few years have gone by so quickly. It'll be a big year for me because I'll be studying abroad in Japan for a month and graduating high school too.. I'm really nervous about graduating, despite being homeschooled for the most part. I don't rly feel ready to be an adult still.<br><br>

Last month i found out that my dear friend was killed in a horrific car accident. She was in her grandma's car when it was hit by an airborne truck. Her grandma and father died immediately, and she passed a few days later in the hospital. She would've just turned 17 and She wanted to work at a bakery next summer. She was so so kind and funny and she loved drain gang so we always talked about it together.. I'll really miss enjoying new music with her. Her kindness & positivity were so infectious, i could only strive to be half as generous as her. i miss her so bad. I haven't been able to stop crying every day. I'd do anything to talk with her just once more, it hurts so much and the guilt has been eating away at me. why do people like her 
  die so tragically and suddenly? she had so much more potential, i wish it was me so badly :(<br>
My Christmas was okay otherwise. My parents got me a Raspberry Pi. I don't know what I'll do with it yet.<br><img src="https://files.catbox.moe/szhmc7.png"></p>

  </div><p>My grandma died last month. Her decomposing body
   was partially consumed by her cats, which had also subsequently died a few days later. She wasn't found for an entire week. She mustve been lonely because she wrote my dad as her sole emergency contact, despite not having spoken
   for nearly a decade. When i first met her in arizona, she seemed really generous. We were visiting family down south after my dad lost his job due to  the great recession. On the  trip from Washington, we slept in a van and even camped along the way. it was so fun, it just felt like a big roadtrip to little 5 year old me, 
    not yet mature enough to grasp the dire circumstances. i really fell in love with nature.<br><br> 
    When we got to arizona, we stayed with my uncle for a few weeks. Him and my dad were abused severely by my grandma 
    growing up, and both of them were fundamentally changed as a result. In my uncle's case, he grew up into an explosive man with very rigid standards for his family's roles. His poor son was picked on for any effeminate behavior he displayed and frequently told to drop down and give him pushups. He's serving in the marines right now.<br><br>
    My uncle hated that i wouldn't willingly give him hugs or talk (i was mute at this age), and would 
    try to force it, which just freaked me out, so i'd avoid him. That pissed him off, and thus became a cycle of fear, avoidance, and his retaliation. He would punish me if i wasn't affectionate enough, by taking away my toys or video games. Skyrim had just released that year and 
    my dad introduced it to me so we were playing a lot. I was just 5 so i needed his help with combat but i just loved exploring the world.<br><br>After a few weeks in Pheonix, my grandma gifted us her two story house for free and moved into her own apartmnet. She got me so many
   dresses and toys, and we lived in there for about 6 months. Sometimes when she'd visit, vshe would get angry that i wasn't wearing the dresses she bought me.<br>
    <br>One night, she called my dad furious, and said if we weren't fully moved out in an hour, she'd call the police.
   My parents were so confused and stressed, rushing to pack everything up. They sent me on a walk with my uncle while they scrambled everything together. I was skipping and running to try
   to keep my mind off of the events unfolding, but my uncle snapped at me to stop. I was trying not to cry because i thought my parents would go to jail. 
    My grandma did end up sending the police but they were understanding and we left Arizona after that. I did lose 
  my cat Sadie because my parents couldn't get her out of the house in time, she was hiding behind the cupboards from all the chaos. i missed her a lot But im over it now.</p></div></div></div><div class="box2" id="shortnav" style="width:20.5%; border:.1em black solid; position:relative;"><center>
