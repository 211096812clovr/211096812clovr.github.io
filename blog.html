       My adrenaline shakes me awake like a blaring alarm clock every morning. There's a deep chill in my bones, nausea creeps up my throat. 
    On some days, I can wait out the worst of the sickness, but on others, I'm dry heaving into the afternoon. There's nothing to even throw up except for water and my own stomach acid. Nowadays when i try to eat,
     my body just rejects it anyways. Even Angel said he's worried and I need to gain some weight. It was only exciting for a brief moment, but the feeling was replaced quickly with nothingness. I feel more devoid than ever. The only thing that really kept me going for so long was stepping on the scale in the morning and seeing the number plummet. 
     I never cared so much about this idealistic end goal of thinness. I was addicted to the rush of losing the weight, but it was just another futile attempt to take any ounce of control over my life. Now it's just another thing that makes me hate myself.<br><br>
     I wish i didn't leave the shelter so badly, I really feel like it was my only hope at survival, but I feel so terrible for wasting 
    their resources, resources that are already running low as it is. He told me to write an apology letter to the shelter but I'm not going to. I didn't lie about anything.
     I didn't even tell them his name.<br><br>
    My birthday would be next month, but I just can't let myself live to 19. 18 was bad enough, i'm not contributing anything to the world. It's not even that i want to die, I just feel so 
    guilty for being alive. 
    And it's hard being all alone. I miss CJ and i miss my mom and my cats. I'm just not meant to have friends. I'm 
    only useful  as a punching bag. I just make everyone sad. 
     Angel has been ignoring me for a couple days. I think he was the last person who even bothered with me. 
<br><br>
    I realize that my perception might be distorted because when I try imagining someone else in my situation, I csn't find any reason why they'd be deserving of death.
     But only I've lived in this body, so if anyone, I'd know best whether I deserve to die or not.<br><br>The other day I scratched his face with scissors so
     hard that he bled. I don't know why. I think I was just trying to get him away from me but I feel so bad. He ripped apart my stuffed bear that I took everywhere with me. I know it's stupid and childlish but I've had ot since I was a baby,
     I'm autistic 
    and that stupid bear helped me sleep at night. Eveb when I woke up in pain i would just squeeze him really tight until it was over. 
     He stabbed it over and over and ripped all the stuffing out.
     He said I need ro stop relying on childish stuff and that I'd be grateful for this one day. It's so stupid but it sort of feels like i've lost my only friend. It's my fault and I know I shouldn't even hqve a stuffed animal 
    at 18, let alone be so attached to it. I tried to collect all of the pieces but he is really mangled and I don't have a needle nor thread to try to stitch him back together.<br><br>
    Twice now he has given me the means to die, and then stopped me at the last second. 
    This time I'm walking to the bridge alone and jumping myself. I can't swim so if the fall doesn't kill me (which it likely won't, it's not a very high fall) I'm sure to drown.  
     I don't want to do this but I've exhausted my options. I should have stayed at the shelter but I feel so guilty for 
    wasting space and i can't show my face there again. I can't just keep leeching off of other people because I'm helpless by myself. I'm a net negative.

    <p>Yesterday, he said if i wasn't dead by the time he was home, he would kill me. But i didn't want to 
    die last night because i was  really scared, i coulnd't bring myself to do it. When he got home he was really gentle and kind to me. He 
    said it wasn't too late, he helped me retie the rope to the door and i hung myself. He grabbed me and said it was just a joke. He was crying 
      and apologizing and begging me not to do it. I felt confused but I couldn't help myself from hugging him back, it felt like 
      he really cared about me.

    <p>My plans were obviously postponed! I don't want to write about that right now. Instead, I dedicate this entry to my dearest late 
    friend CJ.<br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/UUNRQwS.jpeg" width=33%><br><br>CJ was my best (and only) friend. We met online when I was 14. I was feeling completely alone and out of sheer 
      desperation, i created a discord server (lol) with just myself, and posted it on disboard. CJ was my first member. 
    We hit it off instantly because we were super similar and only a year apart, her being 13 at the time. I got her into drain gang and music became our favorite thing to talk about. 
      Both of us felt rather aimless, we both had primarily creative interests and a fear of growing up. CJ and I both struggled with anorexia and we bonded really strongly over that. i think a lot of anorexics
       are scared to become adults and try to cling onto childhood. I'm sure it has to do with the lack of control, but it was 
      hard to find other people who understood. We even followed each other on edtwt, we were so locked in.
<br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/Q7nOnGS.jpeg" width=40%><br>she was so based!<br><br>
    It really felt like we were surviving through something together. We were friends for a few years and we planned to meet up this year because she was
     going to be in my state. She was often busy when school first started up and i was super depressed so i didn't think much of it when 
    she stopped replying to my texts for a month or two. I remember just assuming she was having fun with her new friends from school, since she was finally 
      recovering from her eating disorder and seemed so much happier. 
     i checked her instagram profile one day, and i saw a couple "rip" comments on her latest post. My heart dropped but i thought it mustve been some sort of joke, i was struggling to process it. 
    I immediately searched her full name and state online just to make sure there was nothing there, but i ended up finding an obituary. I was devastated. I was sobbing so hard from the moment i woke up until i cried myself to sleep, only interspersed with brief periods of numbness from 
      sheer exhaustion.<br><br>After a few weeks, i began researching somewhat obsessively. 
      I wanted to know everything i could about her final moments, i was searching for any semblance of closure 
      that i'm still yet to find. I wish i could know what she what she was thinking before it happened, 
      if it was painful or if she fell unconscious fast. Did she know she was going to die? Her last post on her 
      private instagram was about how she wanted to die all day. That makes me real sad. 
      I found a few articles that went into detail about the crash and i could roughly piece together what happened. 
      <br><br>CJ was on a road trip with her family. 
     Her grandma was driving with her dad in the passenger seat, and CJ and her older sister in the back. They had just gotten lunch and they were on their way to a concert. 
    They were stopped at an intersection when an airborne truck crashed into them from an opposing street, hitting the car from CJ's side. CJ's grandma and father
     were pronounced dead on the scene. CJ and her sister were airlifted to hospital but only her sister survived and CJ was pronounced 
    braindead a few days later. I haven't been the same since i found out. Even a year later, i still think about it every day, and 
    i just wish so badly that it was me instead. She had so much going for her and i knew she was going to do something great. She loved baking and planned to apply for a job at the bakery that year. She was 
    a ballet dancer, she loved helping and frequently volunteered at humane societies and homeless shelters. She was the kindest person i've met 
    and so uplifting. I stgill can't process it. it's too painful and i've been completely alone ever since.</p><P>i would give anything 
    to be able to talk to her one last time. If there were a definitive afterlife, i would kill myself right now just to talk to her and feel her warmth one last time, just to get the closure im desperate for. 
      I never asked her what she thought about Cold Visions, but i saw she added every song to her playlist. We had our own shared playlist too, and she added so many more songs than me, so i feel guilty about that as well. 
      I think she always put more effort than me. I loved her but i was so depressed and sometimes i isolated myself. I took her for granted and
       assumed we just had infinite time together, that there was always tomorrow. I'm crushed.</P><img src="https://i.imgur.com/eAvdeFi.jpeg" width=40%></div>

    <p>
      Today I went outside with Angel to go to a festival. It was pretty overwhelming, there were so many people and it eas so loud!!! We passed a guy holding a huge anti-abortion sign, I was so mad that I flipped him off. I immediately felt really guilty, I did it
       out of anger but I'd never done something so rude before. Angel was getting annoyed, he called me retarded and left me alone at the park. I started crying hysterically because I was scared and sad. And eeveryone was looking at me. I decided in that moment that I'll CTB as soon as i can.
 I plan to commit suicide on the 1st, one week and a day from now. Angel says he'll let me use his gun, as long as he can video record my death and post it online. I don't feel comfortable
 with that, but I'm so desperate and this is my only chance to actually die, so i'm taking it. I won't have the capacity to care about tjat video if i am dead. I just need him to keep his word.
      <br><br>It's sad it's come to this, it's a very spontaneous choice. But i've made up my mind. There used to be some things i used to enjoy, like drawing, that kept me around for so long. I don't think I'll leave a note. It's too hard to think. I haven't slept or eaten much over the past few weeks. Angel has been making me eat
       only DOG FOOD because he thinks i am fat. I AM 90 POUNDS! i am living in hell. There is no  hope left and i wish i could get things over with sooner. I won't be able to say bye to my cats but 
      they have my family to take care of them wstill. i'm happy with this. I really am!!<br><br>

    Today I mostly cleaned up around the apartment and drew in my sketchbook. i'm staying at my friend's house until i have another place to stay. 
    He has always been sort of violent, he has weird rage episodes in which he becomes nearly unrecognizable.
     Yesterday I was sitting on the floor watching him play Valorant when he got a call from his girlfriend. He handed me his controller and told me to make sure he didn't die. 
    I really suck at shooter games and I've never used an xbox controller so i died pretty quickly. 
    He was pissed when he got off the phone and he squeezed my neck really hard. He said I always ruin everything. i don't remember passing out, but i woke up and my body was convulsing.
    </p><p>I'm yearning BAD. I just daydream all day about people who were nice to me in brief interactions. I'm so starved for kindness and warmth, i get so 
    infatuated with anyone i meet. But i can't talk to people well so i never get to know anyone. It's too late now, but it seems like more trouble than it's worth anyways. I'm just not meant to connect with other people,
       no matter how lonely i feel. i think i'm going to die.</p>
  </P></div>
  <div id="entry6"><div style="border-bottom: .2em dashed blue; text-align:right;">3/23/2025</div><p>I'm always in my head but i rarely vocalize any of my thoughts. I feel like i've lost the ability to talk to others entirely because of how severe my social anxiety has gotten. Everything about me is humiliating and it's not worth ruminating for days later. just thinking about how others percieve me makes me so anxious that i get nauseous, but i obsess over it. I can never reply to any of my friends because i cannot conjure a perfect enough message to my own skewed standards, especially when it's hard to think at all through all of my brain fog. Everyone else has a job now so i can barely see my friends in real life anymore. I am the most incapable person in the world and it's a miracle that i'm even alive. i don't understand how other people can put themselves out there and make a lot of friends, i'm so envious of that. I hate being percieved more than anything else.<br><br>I get sweaty and i stutter when i talk to people and i can tell everyone thinks i'm a freak. Whenever i go to parties, it's hard for me to match their energy. I'm really kind but everything i say feels pathetic and awkward. When people talk to me, i feel like it's out of pity, and i'm so intimidated by everyone, too. My friend texted me the other day that all of his friends love me
     and i was even invited to a birthday party coming up, so i know my perception of myself must be somewhat distorted, or maybe they don't mind that i'm so pathetic.
     I would call myself a femcel but i somehow attract men despite my social ineptitude. But i think they just sense my vulnerability. Ever since i was little, i've just felt like an object. i don't know why me. 
    boys used to argue over me and even chase after me. i just felt uncomfortable by it, i never enjoyed the attention.<br></p></div>

I haven't updated this in almost a month. To be honest, I just feel like dying most days. I can't bring myself to do anything.
<br><br>
I took a high dose of benadryl last night, and I feel so disoriented and unreal today. I slept for at least 14-15 hours, but I still feel tired. My vision has been shaking all day, like jittering.
<br><br>
My birthday was last month. it was okay. I didn't do much, but my friend walked over to my house and gave me a card and some ponies. I also got a speaker from my parents, which made me happy. I feel even worse about myself as i get older, I'm 17 now and I'm still going nowhere. I feel like such a failure. I'm usually alone, so I just sit in the dark of my room and listen to music most of the time. My favorite things to listen to right now are Bladee and cocteau twins.</p>

    It's been awhile since i updated my blog. I had physical therapy today. It's not really helping because my hip joints are still subluxing every day. I already have 
    arthritis and my doctor said i'll need to replace them eventually because of the damage. I'm trying to prevent it from worsening with physical therapy because there's no way
     I could afford such a surgery.<br><br>I went to a Halloween concert for my birthday. I only really went to see Bejalvin's 100 gecs cover set, the other cover sets were for numetal bands like Limp Bizkit and Korn, which I don't really listen to. Costumes were mandatory, so I went as Fluttershy, and a few people recognized my costume there, which was really exciting! I made the skirt and wings by myself.
   I went trick or treating  with my friends this year. I might be getting too old now, but i had fun.<br>I am feeling excited to continue writing here again<br><iframe width="280" height="162" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8AW1V8LOAw8?si=uYNX_WByHFx4vf-p" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<div id="entry5"><div style="border-bottom: .2em dashed blue; text-align:right;">01/01/2025</div><p>Happy New Year! I can't believe it's 2025 already, the past few years have gone by so quickly. It'll be a big year for me because I'll be graduating high school. I'm really nervous about graduating, despite being homeschooled for the most part. I don't feel ready to be an adult still.<br><br>

A week before Christmas, my closest friend was killed in a horrific car accident. She was in her grandma's car when it was hit by an airborne truck. Her grandma and father died immediately, and she died a few days later in the hospital. She would've just turned 17 this month. She wanted to work at a bakery this summer. She was so so kind and funny and she loved drain gang so we always talked about it together. I'll really miss enjoying new music with her when it comes out. She was so nice and her positivity was so infectious. She always complimented and uplifted me, and i could only wish to be as generous as her. i miss her so bad. I haven't been able to stop crying every day since it happened. I'd do anything to talk with her again, it hurts so much and the guilt has been eating away at me.<br>
My Christmas was okay otherwise. My parents got me a Raspberry Pi. I don't know what I'll do with it yet.<br><img src="https://files.catbox.moe/szhmc7.png"></p>

  </div><p>My grandma died last month. Her decomposing body
   had been eaten by her cats, which had also subsequently died a few days later. She had no one in her life so she wrote my dad as her emergency contact, despite not having had contact
   with him for nearly a decade. She seemed so generous at first, when i met her in arizona at 5 years old. She moved out and gifted us her old two story house. She bought me so many
   dresses and toys, and we lived in her house for 6 months. Sometimes she would get mad that i wasn't wearing her dresses when she would visit,
     but i remember feeling mostly neutrally towards her during my time in her house.<br>
    <br>One night, she called my dad furious, and said if we weren't fully moved out in an hour, she'd call the police.
   My parents were so confused and stressed, rushing to pack everything up. They sent me on a walk with my uncle while they scrambled everything together. I was skipping and running to try
   to keep my mind off of the events unfolding, but my uncle snapped at me to stop. I was trying not to cry because i thought my parents would go to jail. 
    My grandma did end up sending the police but they were understanding and we left Arizona after that. I did lose 
  one of my cats because my parents couldn't get her out of the house in time. But i am over it now.</p></div></div></div><div class="box2" id="shortnav" style="width:20.5%; border:.1em black solid; position:relative;"><center>
