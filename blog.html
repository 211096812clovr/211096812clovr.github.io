    <div id="entry2"><div style="border-bottom: .2em dashed blue; text-align:right;">7/08/2025</div><p>Today was really hard. I was hanging out 
   with my friend and he got a phone call, so he asked me to make sure he did not die in his game. I am not good at most video games, and I was a bit
    caught off guard by his sudden request, so I died almost immediately. My friend finished his call and he was soo pissed. I felt so bad and i 
      kept apologizing, but he 
   said it didn't mean anything/. He got on top of me and squeezed my neck really hard. I must've passed out because I woke up disoriented, and my 
  body was spasming. He said I always ruin everything. It's so sad to hear that.
      
    I don't know why it hurts so bad. I hate being such a waste of space. I can feel it everytime I walk into a room, that I shouldn't be there, and I have no right to be. I do want to be loved and i try really hard, but I am just fundamentally wrong and i cannot fool anyone into thinking i'm
    good. I just wish i was normal so bad. Whenever i go to parties, everyone around me has so many friends. They all act in a certain way that i just
    can't, always very loud voices and expressive body language, it makes everyone want to talk to them. i wish i could be charismatic like that. I can't fit in no matter how hard i try. I am always stiff and my voice is so feeble. I get so scared when I talk to anyone. I am soo pathetic. I try to be good but I just can't. I only deserve to be treated badly.</p></div>
