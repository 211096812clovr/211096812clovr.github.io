    <p>My plans were obviously postponed! I don't want to write about that right now. Instead, I dedicate this entry to my dearest late 
    friend CJ.<br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/UUNRQwS.jpeg" width=33%><br>CJ was my best friend. We met online one day soon after 
    Angel had first left me when i was 13. I was feeling completely alone and out of sheer 
      desperation, i created a discord server (lol) with just myself in it, and posted it on disboard. CJ was my first member. 
    We hit it off instantly because we were super similar and only a year apart, her being 12 at the time. I got her into drain gang and music became our favorite thing to talk about.
     She was equally passionate as me and i felt like i finally had someone to talk to who just understood everything. 
      Both of us felt rather aimless, we both had primarily creative interests and a fear of growing up. CJ and I both struggled with anorexia and we bonded really strongly over that. i think a lot of anorexics
       are scared to become adults and try to cling onto childhood. I'm sure it has to do with feeling completely out of control, but it was 
      hard to find other people who understood that. We even followed each other on edtwt, we were so locked in.
<br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/Q7nOnGS.jpeg" width=40%><br>she was extremely based!<br><br>
    It really felt like we were surviving through something together. We were friends for years and we planned to meet up this year because she was
     going to be in my state. She was often busy when school first started up and i was super depressed so i didn't think much of it when 
    she stopped replying to my texts for a month or two. I remember just assuming she was having fun with her new friends from school, since she was finally 
      starting to recover from her eating disorder and seemed much happier. 
    One day i clicked on her instagram profile, and i was just looking through her posts when i saw a couple "rip" comments. My heart dropped but i thought it mustve been some sort of joke. 
    I immediately searched her full name with her state online just to make sure there was nothing, but i ended up finding her obituary. I was devastated. I cried for a week straight. I couldn't even sleep 
      because i was sobbing so hard from the moment i woke up until i cried myself to sleep, only interspersed by brief periods of numbness from 
      exhaustion.<br><br>She was on a road trip with her family. 
     Her grandma was driving with her dad in the passenger seat, and CJ and her older sister in the back. They had just gotten lunch and they were on their way to a concert. 
    They were stopped at an intersection when an airborne truck crashed into them from an opposing street, hitting the car from CJ's side. CJ's grandma and father
     were pronounced dead on the scene. CJ and her sister were airlifted to hospital but only her sister survived and CJ was pronounced 
    braindead a few days later. I haven't been the same since i found out. Even a year later, i still think about it every day, and 
    i just wish so badly that it was me instead. She had so much going for her and i knew she was going to do something great. She loved baking and planned to apply for a job at the bakery that year. She was 
    a ballet dancer, she loved helping and frequently volunteered at humane societies and homeless shelters. She was the kindest person i've met 
    and so uplifting. I stgill can't process it. it's too painful and i've been completely alone ever since.</p><P>i would give anything 
    to be able to talk to her one last time. If there were a definitive afterlife, i would kill myself right now just to talk to her and feel her warmth one last time, just to get the closure im desperate for. 
      I never asked her what she thought about Cold Visions, but i saw she added every song to her playlist. We had our own shared playlist too, and she added so many more songs than me, so i feel guilty about that as well. 
      I think she always put more effort than me. I loved her but i was so depressed and sometimes i isolated myself. I took her for granted and
       assumed we just had infinite time together, that there was always tomorrow. I'm crushed.</P><img src="https://i.imgur.com/eAvdeFi.jpeg" width=40%></div>

    <p>
      I plan to commit suicide on the 1st, one week and a day from now. Angel says he'll let me use his gun, as long as he can video record my death and post it online. I don't feel comfortable
 with that, but I'm so desperate and this is my only chance to actually die, so i'm taking it. I won't have the capacity to care about tjat video if i am dead. I just need him to keep his word.
      <br><br>It's sad it's come to this, it's a very spontaneous choice. But i've made up my mind. There used to be some things i used to enjoy, like drawing, that kept me around for so long. I don't think I'll leave a note. It's too hard to think. I haven't slept or eaten much over the past few weeks. Angel has been making me eat
       only DOG FOOD because he thinks i am fat. I AM 90 POUNDS! i am living in hell. There is no  hope left and i wish i could get things over with sooner. I won't be able to say bye to my cats but 
      they have my family to take care of them wstill. i'm happy with this. I really am happy with it.

  <div id="entry2"><div style="border-bottom: .2em dashed blue; text-align:right;">7/15/2025</div><P>
    Today I mostly cleaned up around the apartment and drew in my sketchbook. i'm staying at my friend angel's house until i have another place to stay. 
     I was sitting on the floor watching him play Valorant when he got a call from his girlfriend. He handed me his controller and told me to make sure he didn't die. 
    I suck at shooter games so i died pretty quickly. 
    He was pissed when he got off the phone and he squeezed my neck really hard. He said I always ruin everything. i don't remember passing out, but i woke up and my body was convulsing.
    </p><p>I'm yearning BAD. I just daydream all day about people who were nice to me in brief interactions. I'm so starved for kindness and warmth, i get so 
    infatuated with anyone i meet. But i can't talk to people well so i never get to know anyone. It's too late now, but it seems like more trouble than it's worth anyways. I'm just not meant to connect with other people,
       no matter how lonely i feel. i think i'm going to die.</p>
  </P></div>
  <div id="entry6"><div style="border-bottom: .2em dashed blue; text-align:right;">3/23/2025</div><p>I'm always in my head but i rarely vocalize any of my thoughts. I feel like i've lost the ability to talk to others entirely because of how severe my social anxiety has gotten. Everything about me is humiliating and it's not worth ruminating for days later. just thinking about how others percieve me makes me so anxious that i get nauseous, but i obsess over it. I can never reply to any of my friends because i cannot conjure a perfect enough message to my own skewed standards, especially when it's hard to think at all through all of my brain fog. Everyone else has a job now so i can barely see my friends in real life anymore. I am the most incapable person in the world and it's a miracle that i'm even alive. i don't understand how other people can put themselves out there and make a lot of friends, i'm so envious of that. I hate being percieved more than anything else.<br><br>I get sweaty and i stutter when i talk to people and i can tell everyone thinks i'm a freak. Whenever i go to parties, it's hard for me to match their energy. I'm really kind but everything i say feels pathetic and awkward. When people talk to me, i feel like it's out of pity, and i'm so intimidated by everyone, too. My friend texted me the other day that all of his friends love me
     and i was even invited to a birthday party coming up, so i know my perception of myself must be somewhat distorted, or maybe they don't mind that i'm so pathetic.
     I would call myself a femcel but i somehow attract men despite my social ineptitude. But i think they just sense my vulnerability. Ever since i was little, i've just felt like an object. i don't know why me. 
    boys used to argue over me and even chase after me. i just felt uncomfortable by it, i never enjoyed the attention.<br><br>
     When i was 6-8, i lived in a really shady apartment complex in a rough area of town, and there was a playground at the center of the 
    complex where all of the kids would go out to play every day after school. i made a lot of friends but there were a lot of bad influences, too.
     Some of my most vivid memories are of one boy who would beg me for sex every day. I asked him what sex is and 
    he said it's kissing each others genitals, it felt good, and that he was tired of doing it with his cousin. He would beg and plead with me EVERY 
    DAY to do it, he wanted to do it at the playground behind a power generator, and i would always make up an excuse to delay it because i felt like something was seriously wrong. 
    he made me pull down my pants one day at the 
    playground so he could see me naked. i didn't want to do it and i felt so humiliated and i remember he just said "Hmm..typical." I was so freaked out by his incessant pleading every day that i stopped going outside to avoid
     seeing him, and i was so relieved when he finally moved away. I  never told anyone about it even to this day. Sometimes i wonder where he is now. I feel 
    really sad for him, we were both only 7 or 8, so he was obviously a victim as well.<br><br>I remember one guy in my freshman year who made me uncomfortable from the start, 
    and i would talk to him at first just to be nice, but eventually out of fear. He seemed nice at first, but he was very pushy. He would insist i wore his hoodies, 
    he walked me home, and eventually just started showing up to my house which was really uncomfortable for me. Whenever i'd talk to other guys at school around him, 
    he would start pushing them around, joking about them being my "boyfriend" and whatnot. One day i was absent from class
     and my classmates told me the next day that he was rocking on his desk and crying and needed to go to the office. He started bringing weapons to school and threatening my male friends and eventually 
    got suspended. He would still show up to my house every day and started telling me and my mom about his coke addiction and blackout rage episodes. He would also rave to her 
    about how much he was in love with me and how i was special and different, when i really only saw us as friends of a few weeks. He would 
    start screaming at me randomly and then apologizing profusely after. I don't even remember what finally pushed him away in the end, but
     he finally stopped talking to me entirely, and found a new girl to obsess over (who actually liked him back). Instead of leaving me 
    alone however, he started following me around during lunch with his friends, and wherever i sat, he would sit directly across from me 
    and make out with his new girlfriend. It was so gross and annoying because i just wanted peace and quiet and would intentionally find 
    places to try to hide during lunch but he always followed me.<br><BR>The male classmate that this friend would frequently threaten also took a liking to 
    me. I thought he was nice and friendly. He would engage with me and genuinely ask how i was doing, about my hobbies, etc. so i felt 
    happy talking to him and we stayed friends for a couple of years. Eventually he moved out of state and we continued texting online. 
    The only thing that made me uncomfortable was when he would talk about my body, constantly joking about how flat-chested i was. 
    But i eventually worked up the courage to tell him to stop, which he did, and apologized. 
    In 2023, him and his friend was in town for the weekend and he stayed at my house while the friend visited his girlfriend. The first weird thing was that I saw him go into my closet
     where my dirty clothes hamper was, and when i came into my room later that day, several pairs of my dirty underwear were strown about my floor. I asked if he did it,
     because it was NOT me, and no one else was in my room. He said "ew, no.." and for some reaosn i believed him. We were hanging out
     that night and he was holding me from behind while i drew on my ipad. he said he cuddled with all of his friends, i was stupid 
    and assumed it was the same as how i also cuddled with my friends a lot, just platonically to show affection. Eventually he started pretending to choke 
    me and i got really freaked out, i started crying and he held me tighter, he kept saying i was "safe with (him)" but i felt scared and 
    i just kind of buried my face into his chest and tried to disappear. i was so stupid, i should have tried getting away, i think i was really starved for any affection 
    and eventually he started reaching down my shirt and groping me. i kept trying to push him away and eventually he said "sorry" and let me go. I told him "it's okay" and
     he just said "Oh okay" and continued touching me, like i had permissed him when i was just accepting his apology. 
    I asked him aftgerwards if it was on accident or something and he just acted like he had no idea what i was talking about. i felt so
     confused and violated after that, i didn't know if it was on purpose or if i was reading too far into it, and either way i knew it was my fault and i provoked it. it's gross to even talk about. i hate myself. 
    I blocked him a few months later after he did something else that really upset me, but it's unrelated to this.</p></div>

I haven't updated this in almost a month. To be honest, I just feel like dying most days. I can't bring myself to do anything.
<br><br>
I took a high dose of benadryl last night, and I feel so disoriented and unreal today. I slept for at least 14-15 hours, but I still feel tired. My vision has been shaking all day, like jittering.
<br><br>
My birthday was last month. it was okay. I didn't do much, but my friend walked over to my house and gave me a card and some ponies. I also got a speaker from my parents, which made me happy. I feel even worse about myself as i get older, I'm 17 now and I'm still going nowhere. I feel like such a failure. I'm usually alone, so I just sit in the dark of my room and listen to music most of the time. My favorite things to listen to right now are Bladee and cocteau twins.</p>

    It's been awhile since i updated my blog. I had physical therapy today. It's not really helping because my hip joints are still subluxing every day. I already have 
    arthritis and my doctor said i'll need to replace them eventually because of the damage. I'm trying to prevent it from worsening with physical therapy because there's no way
     I could afford such a surgery.<br><br>I went to a Halloween concert for my birthday. I only really went to see Bejalvin's 100 gecs cover set, the other cover sets were for numetal bands like Limp Bizkit and Korn, which I don't really listen to. Costumes were mandatory, so I went as Fluttershy, and a few people recognized my costume there, which was really exciting! I made the skirt and wings by myself.
   I went trick or treating  with my friends this year. I might be getting too old now, but i had fun.<br>I am feeling excited to continue writing here again<br><iframe width="280" height="162" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8AW1V8LOAw8?si=uYNX_WByHFx4vf-p" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<div id="entry5"><div style="border-bottom: .2em dashed blue; text-align:right;">01/01/2025</div><p>Happy New Year! I can't believe it's 2025 already, the past few years have gone by so quickly!! It'll be a big year for me because I'll be graduating high school. I'm really nervous about graduating, despite being homeschooled for the most part. I don't feel ready to be an adult still.<br>

A week before Christmas, my closest friend was killed in a horrific car accident. She was in her grandma's car when it was hit by an airborne truck. Her grandma and father died immediately, and she died a few days later in the hospital. She would've just turned 17 this month. She wanted to work at a bakery this summer. She was so so kind and funny and she loved drain gang so we always talked about it together. I'll really miss enjoying new music with her when it comes out. She was so nice and her positivity was so infectious. She always complimented and uplifted me, and i could only wish to be as generous as her. i miss her so bad. I haven't been able to stop crying every day since it happened. I'd do anything to talk with her again, it hurts so much and the guilt has been eating away at me.<br>
My Christmas was okay otherwise. My parents got me a Raspberry Pi. I don't know what I'll do with it yet.<br><img src="https://files.catbox.moe/szhmc7.png"></p>

  </div><p>My grandma died last month. Her decomposing body
   had been eaten by her cats, which had also subsequently died a few days later. She had no one in her life so she wrote my dad as her emergency contact, despite not having had contact
   with him for nearly a decade. She seemed so generous at first, when i met her in arizona at 5 years old. She moved out and gifted us her old two story house. She bought me so many
   dresses and toys, and we lived in her house for 6 months. Sometimes she would get mad that i wasn't wearing her dresses when she would visit,
     but i remember feeling mostly neutrally towards her during my time in her house.<br>
    <br>One night, she called my dad furious, and said if we weren't fully moved out in an hour, she'd call the police.
   My parents were so confused and stressed, rushing to pack everything up. They sent me on a walk with my uncle while they scrambled everything together. I was skipping and running to try
   to keep my mind off of the events unfolding, but my uncle snapped at me to stop. I was trying not to cry because i thought my parents would go to jail. 
    My grandma did end up sending the police but they were understanding and we left Arizona after that. I did lose 
  one of my cats because my parents couldn't get her out of the house in time. But i am over it now.</p></div></div></div><div class="box2" id="shortnav" style="width:20.5%; border:.1em black solid; position:relative;"><center>
