    Yay! new year... to celebrate my 2 friends came over and brought synthetic shrooms, we split up 2 packs of 
    gummies and a chocolate bar. i've never tried real shrooms before but this wasn't psychedelic at all, more like drunk, confused, stimulated..?? we took our first gummies at 8pm and stayed up until 8am talking and laughing, playing games and watching music videos. nothing made sense and our conversations were abstract. i noticed we were a little meaner than usual, teasing and jokingly antagonizing each other, which we don't usually do much. it was all jokes but i think we just weren't taking things so seriously.
  </p><p>my face felt like playdough and chewing was the most nauseating feeling...
  my friend and i kept randomly bursting into tears, but we weren't ever sad. our other frnd didnt cry at all but he said his HRT had been preventing him from crying for weeks anyways...is that what higher testosterone
   does to someone, or maybe his body is still adjusting?</p><p>i
     did some research afterwards and realized that we took Amanita Muscaria gummies, not psilocybin, it explained alot. i feel groggy today, probably because i only slept for an hour or so.
     i have a couple gummies left over but i'd really like to try real psilocybin shrooms sometime.
     </p>

       every morning i wake up panicking, a deep chill in my bones and nausea creeping up my throat. i don't get a lot of sleep lately. stay up until angel goes to work around 7, then nap into the afternoon. 
    the bridge, i think about it a lot. i can't swim so if the fall doesn't kill me (which it likely wont) then am i sure to drown? the hardest part will be jumping, and i'm sure it'll be painful too.
     I just cant keep leeching off of other people because im helpless by myself.

      <p>CJ was my best friend, We met on discord in early 2022. I was feeling lonely and out of sheer 
      desperation, i created a server with just myself (lol), and posted it on disboard. miraculously, CJ became my first member! 
    We hit it off instantly, we were realy similar in personality and she wanted to help improve my server. music became our favorite thing to talk about and i got her into drain gang too, she was a huge fan. she loved jeff buckley amd the smiths. 
      i think Both of us felt kinda aimless and scared to grow up. she also struggled with restrictive eating so we bonded a lot over that. We were so locked in, we were even oomfs on edtwt.</p>

    <p>i was really busy last summer so i didn't think much of it when 
    she stopped replying for a few weeks. I noticed the absence of her usual instagram stories but just assumeed she was having fun with her new school friends, she was finally 
      recovering from her ED and she seemed so much happier than before. 
      i was radnomly checking her profile for any updates when i saw an "rip" comment on her post. My heart dropped but i didnt believe it, i thought it mustve been a joke. 
    i googled her name & city just in case, and an obituary was the first result. she had died 2 weeks prior, june 12 2024. i was in shock; it was hard to process. for weeks, i held back tears in class and started crying right when i got home until i fell asleep at night. i kept having recurring dreams where shse was still alive. one time 
        she even apologized for making me worry...waking up was heartbreaking every morning<br><br>on june 10th, CJ was on a road trip with her family, headed to a concert. 
     They stopped at an intersection when an airborne car came from a perpendicular street, crashing into CJ's side of the car. her grandma and dad
     were pronounced DOA, CJ and her sister were airlifted to hospital but only her sister survived. she was taken off of life support 2 days later and several of her organs were donated. it's too tragic, she was soooooo young. She loved baking, drawing, ballet. she was so kindhearted, alwys uplifting her friends. just infectiously positive, even
       when she wasn't so happy hereslf :( i wish i couldve taken her place instead, she had so much more future potential. a mutual friend of Cj said something like "
        live for the future she diddn't get to have" but it's too sad, i don't know how to handle such a loss.
   </p><P>i would give anything 
    to talk to her again, to tell her how much i love her, to ask how she felt, just any semblance of closure. sometimes i message her or comment on her posts. it;s unnerving that shes not even Here anymore... she doesnt even exist anymore my friend???. WTF :( 
      I never asked her what she thought about Cold Visions but she added every single song to her playlist. We had our own spotify playlist too, she added more songs than i did... 
      She would've been 18 this year. I took her for granted and
       assumed we had unlimited time together, that there was always tomorrow. she was so beautiful and  she was sooo funny too. im crushed nothing is the same without her.</P></div>

    i'm staying at my friend's house. i'm not allowed to go home right now because im cutting my self and smoking weed and im almost 19 with no job or Anything. i'm a bum fr. i like to self pity but 
    i think most people have hard lives and sitll cope Way better than me. if natural selection had it's way, i would've never made it this far!!! 
    </p><p>I'm yearning BAD... sometimes i just daydream about people who were nice to me in brief interactions, strangers, crave gentleness, fuck my chud life!!</p>

I haven't updated this in almost 2 months. TBH i just feel like dying most days and i cant bring myself to do anything producitve. last year i told my paremts i would blow my brains out 
    if i had to stay in public school, i'm just 
    taking a few electives inperson while i do the rest online. there's a lunch period between those classes. i used to wait it out in the library and draw because it's so peaceful in there, 
    but there's this evil boy named qwinton...he follows me eberwhere i go... :( i will tell the story of qwinton but its really sad...<br><br>He was in my science class last year and just latched onto me i think. 
    he  would say such intense things like "my life changed when i met u" amd make disturbing jokes like calling me flat chesetd during class. i would just ignore it because i didnt know how to react...
    <br><br> he was really insistant so i let him walk me home one day after school. i REALLY shouldnt have, he started showing up all the time and  he would tell my mom how much he liked me, he even opened up about his coke habit & blackout rages. 
    i really should've set firm boundaries sooner, im such a pushover :P<br><br>
    Things were spiraling fast and i started dreading school, one day i skipped class and classmates told me that he cried at his desk until he was sent to the office...he started getting angry when i spoke to male peers...
    I remember one time, his backpack was confiscated by a resource officer, he never told me what was inside...
    eventually i toold him i was uncomfortable and he never spoke with me again (which i was ok with LOL.)<br><br>This year, he got a GF and the following began... anywhere i sit
     for lunch, they sit right across from me and MAKE OUT.
    i dont know if he's trying to make me feel jealous or soemthing but i just find it gross & annoying, i just want to be alone. my eternal tormentors...i dont even know why brooo i was alwys nice T__T
<br><br>
I took so much benadryl last night, feeling disoriented and unreal today. I slept for like 14 hours  but im exhausted. My vision has been kinda jittering all day. NEVER AGAIN...
<br><br>
My birthday was last month. it was okay. I didn't do much, but my friend walked over to my house and gave me a card and some ponies. I also got a speaker from my parents, it was a really good gift. I feel even worse about myself as i get older, I'm 17 now and I'm still going nowhere. I feel like such a failure. I'm usually alone, so I just sit in the dark of my room and listen to music most of the time. Sometimes i draw. I love listening to bladee adn cocteau twins.

    It's been awhile since i updated my blog. I had physical therapy today, she gave me some new exercises to strengthen my chest area because my rib keep shifting over my 
    sternum and i have to pop it back in. All i can do is try to strengthen the muscles a bit where my joints are unstable. I learned recently that hEDS is usually more severe in women 
    because they hve lower muscle mass, less support keeping their joints in place.<br><br>I went to a Halloween concert for my birthday. I only really went to see Bejalvin's 100 gecs cover set, the others were for numetal bands like Limp Bizkit and Korn, which I don't Rly listen to. It was so much fun it was really worth it..... I went as Fluttershy. a few people recognized my costume there!! I made the skirt and wings myself.
   I went trick or treating  with my friends this year. I feel like we're getting a little old for it now, but they always insist, and i had fun.<br><iframe width="280" height="162" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8AW1V8LOAw8?si=uYNX_WByHFx4vf-p" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>

It'll be a big year for me because i'm studying abroad in Japan for a month and graduating too.. i don't feel ready to be an adult. my dad told me that im going nowhere in life wjen i was just 14, i thought it was just cruel at the time but
   i'm starting to realize he was right. at least i'm not in prison for trashing a mosque like he was at my age...??<br><br>
Christmas was okay, Yule has come to an end... my parents got me a raspberry pi! im not sure what i'll use it for yet.<br><img src="https://files.catbox.moe/szhmc7.png" width="300vh"></p>

  </div><p>My grandma died last month. Her body, partially consumed by her cats, wasn't found for an entire week. She mustve been lonely because she wrote my dad as her sole emergency contact, despite not having contact with him for years.
     I first met her at 5 years old when we were visiting family in Arizona, after my dad lost his job to the great recession.<br><br> 
    We iniially stayed with my uncle for a few weeks. He's a weird guy, would always get angry and punish me for silly reasons, like 
    not wanting to speak or hug him (i was mute at the time, my parents always tried explaining that.)<br><br>
    My grandma randomly gifted us her two-story house, so we didn't stay with my ucnle for long. I remember being extra weary of my grandma, she would get upset for such little reasons too. the house had roaches but i had my own bedroom, i can't remember what it looked like anymore.
    <br><br>One night, my dad got a call from my grandma. she said if we weren't entirely moved out in an hour, she'd call the police.
   My parents sent me on a walk with my uncle while they rushed to pack the hosue. i was kind of skipping to try
   to distract myself, but my uncle told me to stop. i was really scared because i thought my parents would go to jail. 
    The cops were sent, but my parents explained the situation adn they were understanding, we left Arizona after that.<br></Br>I did lose 
  my cat Sadie because my parents couldn't grab her in time, she was hiding from all the chaos and my grandma aws threatening my dad with a knife. i missed Sadie a lot But im over it now.</p></div></div></div><div class="box2" id="shortnav" style="width:20.5%; border:.1em black solid; position:relative;"><center>
