I can't make sense of anything, so there's nothing valuable to write. My brain feels like thick static, or wading through a thick muddy swamp in the pitch black night. i used to be so smart and talented but my mind decayed along with my body. I used to worry i had some sort of early-onset dementia.<br>Im lonely. im extremely lonely but i can't even bring myself to reply when i'm spoken to.
     Most people seem to like me, but my self-perception is distorted, and my anxiety high. i go to functions and i just feel humiliated because i don't belong anywhere. One of the girls at the party asked if i was autistic. so embarrassing. I should kill myself already.
