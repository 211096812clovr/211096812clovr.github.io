<body><div style="height:100%;"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/YttzlXD.png" style="float:left;"></div>I love clovers. but i've never found any 4 leaf ones, only ever 3. i guess i just am not lucky!
 I still look every summer. i wonder if there's a trick to finding them, because some people seem to be really great at it.<br><br>i'm not inhabiting my body anymore. i've been banished somewhere else to watch it all like a bad dream.

i censor myself heavily, even on my  own website. I worry that I've masked so hard that now i just sound like a soulless AI. Everyone else has so much personality on their sites, but i just can't let mine show through without humiliation. Always trying to be as polite and inoffensive as possible!! i'll rewrite my sentences over and over until they sound just right. on my blog, i try to remain genuine without spilling my guts. when I reread my words, they sound 
superficial. Sometimes i worry that i sound stupid and there's no point for me to have a website because i don't contribute anything good with it. That's why I made this secret page; to be honest, even at the cost of ugliness.<br><br>I wish i could bring myself to talk to someone. even when other people reach out to me first, i often cannot bring myself to reply. It's for the same reason. Masking to the level i do isn't sustainable and drains me so quickly.
     I can't type a message without taking 30 minutes to edit it until it's perfect. it's so sad. i feel so happy when i get a message and then so guilty when i never respond. I think about every message i haven't replied to, even from months ago, and it weighs on me heavily. I wonder what other people think of me.
     i have a feeling that my perception of myself could be warped because i despise almost everything about myself, and i assume everyone else does too. the other day, my friend told me that
     when she talks to people, she always assumes the best in them, that they like her and want her there. I realized that i don't do that at all.
     i just assume i'm wasting everyone's time. Everyone reading this blog must think i should kill myself, truly!
