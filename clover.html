<body><img src="https://i.imgur.com/YttzlXD.png" style="float:left;">I love clovers. but i've never found any 4 leaf ones, only ever 3. i guess i just am not lucky!
 I still look every summer. i wonder if there's a trick to finding them, because some people seem to be really great at it.<br><br>
i censor myself heavily, even on my very own webiste. It is just because i can't help but constantly mask and now ive become a soulless robot that only always says the most polite and acceptable and normal-sounding things i can muster. i'll rewrite my sentences over and over until they sound just right; until i sound as broadly likable or inoffensive as possible. i try to remain genuine without spilling my guts every time i write on my blog. I read my words back and they sound almost formally 
superficial. like a soulless AI. But i think i might be really disturbed and i am in near-constant anguish. i have No Plans for the Future other than my eventual suicide (and seeing bladee live in November). I'll likely hang myself if i can't get my hands on SN.
<br><br>I know i am a socially inept femcel freak but please still love me please..  That is all i care about.<br><br>
