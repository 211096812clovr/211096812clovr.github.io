<body><img src="https://i.imgur.com/YttzlXD.png" style="float:left;">I love clovers. but i've never found any 4 leaf ones, only ever 3. i guess i just am not lucky!
 I still look every summer. i wonder if there's a trick to finding them, because some people seem to be really great at it.<br><br>
i censor myself heavily, even on my  own past websites. I masked so hard that now ive become a soulless robot that only always says the most polite and socially acceptable things i can come up with, even to the point of awkardness or over-formality. i'll rewrite my sentences over and over until they sound just right; until i sound as broadly likable or inoffensive as possible. i would try to remain genuine without spilling my guts every time i wrote a blog post. I read my words back and they sound 
superficial, like a soulless AI. That's why I made this secret github page; for ultimate honesty.
<br><br>I know i am a socially inept femcel freak but please still love me please..  That is all i care about.<br><br>

My thoughts are a jumbled mess and i don't feel like my body is my own. i feel like i'm above my own head, and the world around me is fake. The walls start swirling and everything is high contrast static. I was in bed trying to fall asleep, but the feeling swelled inside of me like a balloon 
filling with air but never popping. My soft bed suddenly feels like concrete and my body is so tense. Everything is swollen. I become so conscious of how the inside of my mouth feels. There's two voices. 
    When everything is big, it's mostly screaming. When it's small, there's whispers. It stretches me thin and i just want to sleep already. i'm living in hell.</body>
