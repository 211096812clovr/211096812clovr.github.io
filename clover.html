<body><img src="https://i.imgur.com/YttzlXD.png" style="float:left;">I love clovers. but i've never found any 4 leaf ones, only ever 3. i guess i just am not lucky!
 I still look every summer. i wonder if there's a trick to finding them, because some people seem to be really great at it.<br><br><br>
i censor myself heavily, even on my webiste. i try to remain genuine without spilling my guts every time i write on my blog. I read my words back and they sound almost formally 
superficial. like a soulless AI. But i think i might be really disturbed and i am in near-constant anguish. i have No Plans for the Future other than eventually suicide and also seeing bladee live in November.</body>
