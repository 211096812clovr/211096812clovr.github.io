I can't make sense of anything, so there's nothing valuable to write.<br>My brain feels like thick static, or wading through a thick muddy swamp in the pitch black night. Nothing is tangible and i always feel scared.<br>i sat up and my vision went black. i felt myself collapse, and then i woke up on the floor feeling disoriented, briefly forgetting what happened. my entire body was convulsing and spasming like i was having a seizure. I faint very often without my heart medication. i usually can't afford it now without health insurance.
