I can't make sense of anything, so there's nothing valuable to write.<br>My brain feels like thick static, or wading through a thick muddy swamp in the pitch black night. Nothing is tangible and i always feel scared.<br><br>I faint frequently now without my daily heart medication. i can't afford it anymore after losing my health insurance.<br>Walking feels like intensive exercise and it gets hard to breathe. i always wake up convulsing like i'm having a seizure.
