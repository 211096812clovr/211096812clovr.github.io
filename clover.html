 I still look every summer. i wonder if there's a trick to finding them, because some people seem to be really great at it.<br><br>i'm not inhabiting my body anymore. i've been banished somewhere else to watch it all like a bad dream.

i censor myself heavily, even on my  own past websites. I masked so hard that now i just sound like a soulless AI. Always trying to be as polite and inoffensive as possible!! i'll rewrite my sentences over and over until they sound just right. on my blogs, i would try to remain genuine without spilling my guts. when I reread my words, they sound 
superficial. That's why I made this secret github page; to be honest, even at the cost of ugliness.<br><br>I wish i could bring myself to talk to someone. even when other people reach out to me first, i often cannot bring myself to reply. I am too scared. it's so sad. i feel so happy when i get a message and then so guilty when i never respond. I think about every message i haven't replied to, even from months ago, and it weighs on me heavily.
<br><br>I know i am a socially inept femcel freak but please still love me please..  That is all i care about.
