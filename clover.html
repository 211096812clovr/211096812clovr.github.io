   <p style="float:right;">i want to confess to you many things, but i do not know where to start. The beginning is much too plain, and i do not ave the patience to wait for momentum. The middle is confusing and to establish my story at end is to have wasted all of the experience on my self. Is it okay if we only sit here?<br><br>    IRL im imso pure the mirror refuses to show me back..
 its called purehearted crybaby cyberangel.it’s called ritual cleansing. it’s called flight pretending to be collapse. its called swinging a heavy bat at strangers while blaring Vocaloid. its called i love drunk driving and i have no license.<br><br>its called jumping out of a window on the twelfth floor and flying away./ THAIBOY DIGITAL appeared my ativan sleep paralysis nightmare..He told me that heaven is online. i want To fall into ur arms & sleep eternal... IRL i am pure and unstained btw... your hands pass right thru me</br><br> no matter how disgusting ill never leave yuor side but please.. its not a big deal im just abandon this form....its called birdlogic.. while U are here freaking out we could be buzzing over electrical wires...</p></body>
