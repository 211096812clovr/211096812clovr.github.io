<body><div style="height:100%;"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/YttzlXD.png" style="float:left;"></div>I love clovers. but i've never found any 4 leaf ones, only ever 3. i guess i just am not lucky!
 I still look every summer. i wonder if there's a trick to finding them, because some people seem to be really great at it.<br><br>
i censor myself heavily, even on my  own past websites. I masked so hard that now ive become a soulless robot that only always says the most polite and socially acceptable things i can come up with, even to the point of awkardness or over-formality. i'll rewrite my sentences over and over until they sound just right; until i sound as broadly likable or inoffensive as possible. i would try to remain genuine without spilling my guts every time i wrote a blog post. I read my words back and they sound 
superficial, like a soulless AI. That's why I made this secret github page; for ultimate honesty.<br><br>I wish i could bring myself to talk to someone. even when other people reach out to me first, i often cannot bring myself to reply. I am too scared. it's so sad. i feel so happy when i get a message and then so guilty when i never respond. I think about every message i haven't replied to, even from months ago, and it weighs on me heavily.
<br><br>I know i am a socially inept femcel freak but please still love me please..  That is all i care about.<br><br>

i'm not inhabiting my body anymore. i've been banished somewhere else to watch it all like a bad dream.
the walls start to swirl. everything turns high-contrast and static.<br>
i try to sleep, but something swells inside me like a balloon that won’t pop.<br>
my soft bed becomes concrete. my body tenses. everything feels sharp and hard.
<br><br>
i become hyper-aware of the inside of my mouth; as if i were perceiving the world through it.<br>
the room breathes in and out like a lung. my body too. swelling big, then shrinking small.
<br><br>
i look at my hands. i feel tiny. ant-sized. crushable.
<br>
when it's too big, i hear screaming.
when it shrinks, there’s whispering.
<br>
it stretches me thin.
i just want to sleep already.
<br><br>
i’m living in hell.</body>
