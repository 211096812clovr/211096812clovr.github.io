I can't make sense of anything, so there's nothing valuable to write.<br>My brain feels like thick static, or wading through a thick muddy swamp in the pitch black night. Nothing is tangible and i always feel scared.<br>I faint frequently now, without my daily heart medication. i can't always afford it after i lost my health insurance. Walking feels like hard exercise and it gets hard to breathe. i always wake up convulsing like i'm having a seizure.
