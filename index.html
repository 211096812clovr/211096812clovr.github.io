  it anonymously. Otherwise, it's way too embarrassing
  . This is too much. You can click any link you'd like to navigate around my blog.</P>

<div id="content">
    <div id="entry1"><p>I got beaten up today. I was hanging out 
   with my friend and he had a phone call so he asked me to make sure he did not die in his game. I am not good at most video games, and I was a bit
    thrown off, so I died almost instantly. XD My friend finishes his call and he is soo pissed. I felt so bad and i apologized a lot but he 
   said it didn't mean anything/. He kept saying I always fuck up everything. It's so sad to hear that from someone else.
    I don't know why. I just want to be loved and i try really hard but I am just fundamentally wrong, and i can never fool anyone into thinking i'm
    good. I just wish i was normal so bad. Whenever i go to parties, everyone there has so many friends, and they all act a certain way that i just
    can't, alwaus very loud and expressive body gestures, it makes everyone want to talk to them. i wish i could be like that. When i visited Japan,
    everyone liked me more than in America, because being quiet and polite is more valued in Japan. In the West, to be charismatic, you have to be more 
   loud and extroverted. I can;t fit in no matter how hard i try. I am always stiff and my voice is so feeble. I am soo pathetic. I try to be really kind and social, but people always point out that I'm a little weird. Some people laugh at me or just ignore me. But some people are really kind too. But EVERYONE has to mention 
   that I'm different. I don;t know how to fit in.</p></div>
  <div id="entry2"><p>I had a nightmare last night. The nightmares I have lately are too disturbing to describe, it just makes me feel ashamed of myself. My 
  mood swings got slightly better as I aged out of my peak-hormonal years, but my anxiety and depression have gotten way worse, and the emotional 
  highs have been replaced with a constant buzzing sadness. My psychiatrist said I have anxiety, then it was depression, then BPD, then OCD,
   until he finally settled on autism. I always forget
 if I'm doing good or bad. I'm only ever thinking in the moment, so if something really good happens, then suddenly my life is also really good. But
 if something bad happens, then I've never had a good day in my life, and I've been suffering forever. I'm very dramatic and a black and white thinker.
 But I don't tell anyone anything. I don't have a lot of friends to talk to. And I feel so embarrassed about everything that I do say to people, I
 couldn't imagine the shame if I were to be vulnerable around someone. It's too mushy and I just get uncomfortable. But at the same time, I long
 for someone close who would care about me. I just know that I'm incapable of such a thing. I have the worst attachment style. I could be so
 obsessed with someone one moment, be talking every day, but suddenly disappear for several weeks.</p></div>
